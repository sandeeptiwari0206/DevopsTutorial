🔧 What is Linting in DevOps?

Linting is the process of analyzing source code for errors, bugs, stylistic issues, or deviations from coding standards—without running the code. It uses automated tools called "linters".

🎯 Why is Linting Important in DevOps?

In DevOps, code is integrated and deployed frequently. Poor-quality code can break builds or cause issues in production. Linting ensures:
- Early detection of issues
- Consistent code quality
- Fewer bugs in production
- Cleaner, maintainable code

🛠️ Examples of Linter Tools by Language:

| Language        | Linter Tool       |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Python          | pylint, flake8     |
| JavaScript      | eslint             |
| YAML            | yamllint           |
| Bash            | shellcheck         |
| Dockerfile      | hadolint           |

👨‍💻 Example:

Python code with an error:
def add(x, y):
  return x +  y

This code has an extra space. A linter like flake8 will detect this and warn:
"Extra space detected"

🔁 How Linting Works in a CI/CD Pipeline:

1. Developer writes code
2. Code is pushed to a Git repository
3. CI/CD pipeline triggers automatically
4. Linter runs first to check code quality
5. If issues are found, the pipeline fails and developers fix them
6. If no issues, pipeline continues with testing and build

✅ Benefits:

- Catch issues early
- Standardized codebase
- Faster debugging and troubleshooting
- Improved code readability and maintainability

📂 Example GitHub Actions YAML:

name: Linting Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install flake8
      run: pip install flake8
    - name: Run linter
      run: flake8 .
